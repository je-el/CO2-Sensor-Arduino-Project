## CO2-Sensor-Arduino-Project

#### Group Members:
- Wyatt Bush
- Jewel Maldonado

#### Inspiration for the project/reason:
- <insert details for wyatt's project proposal>
#### What will the project be used for
- This CO2 sensor meter will be used to detect the actual CO2 measurements in parts per million.  
#### Approach and Final Design
- For this project we wanted to create something that would be used in a lab. So we wanted to create an interface that would be simple to use without any complex bells and whistles. We decided to opt for an enclosure and made it so that the device could be positioned well and would not interfere with the seperate measurement tools that will be used to appropriately <finish me>
#### Hardware:
- ATLUS SCIENTIFIC UART/I2C CO2 Sensor
- Other Parts Below:
- 16 x 2 LCD
- Plastic Enclosure
- <finish me>
